This is 42's version of the classical "Dining Philosophers" problem, regularly
used in CS to teach about multithreading and it's common problems and good coding practices.
Like every single other 42 project, it had several goals in mind:
- continued practice of basic C syntax, logic, data types and structures;
- dynamic data allocation managing;
- use of tools like GDB and Valgrind to debug, avoid memory leaks and errors;
- incomplete instructions to promote self learning and error solving;
- familiarity with Makefile and compilers;
- practice the use and manipulation of several threads;
- practice the use of mutexes;
- solving data races, circular dependencies and similar issues;
- use of synchronization techniques and mutexes;
- good code practice for scalability and performance;
- etc;

This project was made while studying in 42 Porto as part of the Computer Science
Common Core curriculum.
It was made according to 42's Norm for good code etiquette, which includes rules regarding:
- correct indentation;
- maximum line lenght of 81 characters;
- maximum function size of 25 lines;
- maximum 5 functions per file;
- mandatory 42 signature file header;
- forbidden use of "for", "do / while", "switch / case", "goto";
and many others...
