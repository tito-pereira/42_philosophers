This project was made while studying in 42 Porto as part of the Computer Science
Common Core curriculum.
It was made according to 42's Norm for good code etiquette, which includes rules regarding:
- correct indentation;
- maximum line lenght of 81 characters;
- function maximum size of 25 lines;
- 5 functions per file;
- mandatory 42 signature file header;
- forbidden use of "for", "do / while", "switch / case", "goto";
and many others...

Synopsis:

This is 42's version of the classical "Dining Philosophers" problem, regularly
used in CS to teach about multithreading and it's common problems and good coding practices.
Like every other 42 project, it had several with several goals in mind:
- continued practice of basic syntax, logic, data types and structs;
- familiarity with C language and Makefile;
- practice the use and manipulation of several threads;
- practice the use of mutexes;
- solving data races, circular dependencies and similar issues;
- use of synchronization techniques and mutexes;
- good code practice for scalability and performance;
- etc;
